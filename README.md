## Linear-Regression (Gradient Descent and Normalization Method)

This repository contains Detailed Implementation of Linear Regression Algorithms from scratch.The following two approaches have been used to train and test the models.


- Gradient Descent(Batch Gradient Descent)
- Normalization Method (Using Vectorized representation of the features to find optimal values of parameters)
